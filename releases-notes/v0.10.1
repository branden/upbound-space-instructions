# v0.10.1

## Notable Changes

1. Added support for setting environment variables on the mcp-router and mcp-controller pods. These settings are accessible via the mxp Helm chart's values.yaml, specifically:
```
mcp-router.extraEnv: []

mcp-controller.extraEnv: []
```

In an effort to maximize flexibility, the `extraEnv` array is processed within the individual `Deployment`s in the following manner:
```
env:
{{- with .Values.extraEnv }}
  {{- toYaml . | nindent 12 }}
{{- end }}  
```
This allows operators to specify environment variables in the various formats the `Deployment` resource expects:
```
- name: key1
  value: value1
- name: key2
  valueFrom: {}
```

2. Added support for setting `Annotations` on the mcp-router `Ingress` resource as well as the individual ControlPlane `Ingress` resource.

These settings are accessible via the mxp Helm chart's values.yaml, specifically:
```
ingress.annotations: {}

mcp-controller.mcp.ingress.annotations: {} 
```
* ingress.annotations: {} - for modifying the `Ingress` handling requests to `proxy.upbound-127.0.0.1.nip.io` in the [space-instructions] doc.
* mcp-controller.mcp.ingress.annotations: {} - for modifying the `Ingress` handling requests to the individual ControlPlane.

3. In an effort to simplify using a different registry (ECR, Artifactory, etc), the various artifacts and dependencies that make up the Spaces installation we're updated to normalize on using the `us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/orchestration-build/upbound-environments` container registry. Operators can override this setting via the mxp Helm chart's values.yaml, specifically:
```
global.container.registry: us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/orchestration-build/upbound-environments
```


## Breaking Changes

The `Group` for the `ControlPlane` kind was updated.
Previous GVK:
```
apiVersion: mxp.upbound.io/v1alpha1
kind: ControlPlane
```

Current GVK:
```
apiVersion: core.mxe.upbound.io/v1alpha1
kind: ControlPlane
```
