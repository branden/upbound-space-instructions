# v0.12.0

## Notable Changes

1. Allow operators to override the ingress-nginx-controller name. Operators can accomplish this by
   setting the following property when installing the `mxp` chart:
   `mcp-controller.mcp.hostCluster.ingressNginx.controllerName=mycontrollername`
2. Introduce Space scoped labels that can be applied via mxp install. Operators can accomplish this
   by setting the following property when installing the chart: `global.labels.key=value`
